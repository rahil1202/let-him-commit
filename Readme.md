## 🔧 What is this?

**Let-Him-Commit** is a fun yet educational CLI tool that automates **GitHub commit generation** and let you commit in the **Past, yes you can commit in the past/history**—  
think of it as your *Git time machine*.  

It helps you learn how automation, APIs, and date-based commit scripting work, all while producing beautiful commit graphs.

> Always use your **own GitHub account** and **private repos**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The tool clones or creates a **private repository** (default: `let-him-cook` 🍳).
2. It generates **commits across selected dates** using a customizable commit range (default: 2–5 per day).
3. Each commit message is templated — you can customize or randomize it.
4. It automatically pushes commits in controlled batches to prevent GitHub rate limits.
5. You get a **beautiful commit history** in minutes.
